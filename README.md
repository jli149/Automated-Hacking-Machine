# Automated-Hacking-Machine
This user-friendly project is designed to educate individuals who are new to the cybersecurity field and lack the necessary hacking experience. It aims to improve their security awareness by conducting automated hacking using Metasploit, Nmap, and Python.

## Pros:
- User-friendly
- Effective
- Demonstrates the hacking process

## Purpose:
- To pique the interest of individuals with little to no hacking experience
- To automate many parts of the hacking process, saving time compared to traditional manual Red Teaming

## Summary:
This script allows users to perform automated penetration testing, identifying security gaps and improving the effectiveness of response procedures. It serves as an educational tool for those exploring the field of cybersecurity, providing a roadmap for future hacking practices. Additionally, it demonstrates how easily a machine can be hacked if vulnerabilities are not addressed. The project involves developing a Python script to conduct automated hacking on the virtual machine Metasploitable2 within 30 seconds, integrating the Nmap module for vulnerability scanning. The script imports the pymetasploitable3.msfrpc library to interact with the Metasploit framework and uses the CSV module to save Nmap scanning results into a CSV file.
